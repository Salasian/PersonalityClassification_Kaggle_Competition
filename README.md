# Personality Classification

This repository presents my solution to the Kaggle's Competition [Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7/overview).

The main goal for this competition is to reach the highest accuracy_score on the competition. To do this the participants need to predict via the train and test dataset features, which personality each person is.
